# s82spec
#repository to store publicly accessible figures of spectral diagnostics and spectral fits
#The diagnostic figures follow the same scheme as Fig 1 in the main paper.
#Each plot shows a candidate galaxy pair, their 2D spectra in the red and blue channels, and the uncalibrated 1D spectra.
#names are the designation for the pair.

#The spectral fits follow the same scheme as Fig 2 in the paper.
#For each of the 35 candidate pairs, there are 2 corresponding spectral fits (one per object), where the file name is the J200 optical ID.
